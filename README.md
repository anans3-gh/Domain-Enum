# Domain-Enum
A Simple PowerShell based AD Enumeration Tool

The script can be used to query AD for Users, Computers, Groups, SPNs , Group Memberships, Specific User Info and User Sessions.

The capabilities of employing PowerShell to call out other Objects besides what is shown here is endless.

So I encourage you to do more than I did with this and share it.
